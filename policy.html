					<p>At Akazi we care about your privacy. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We do not disclose it to others except as disclosed in this Policy or required to provide you with the services of the Site and mobile applications and its related sites, applications, services and goods or any other Site, meaning - to allow you to buy, sell, share the information you want to share on the Site; to contribute on the forum; pay for services; post reviews and so on; or where we have a legal obligation to do so.</p>

					<p class="margin-reset">We collect information that you provide us or voluntarily share with other users, and also some general technical information that is automatically gathered by our systems, such as IP address, browser information and cookies to enable you to have a better user experience and a more personalized browsing experience.</p>

					<p>We will not share information that you provide us in the process of the registration - including your contact information - except as described in this Policy.</p>

					<p>Information that you choose to publish on the Site (photos, videos, text, music, reviews, deliveries) - is no longer private, just like any information you publish online.</p>

					<p>Technical information that is gathered by our systems, or third party systems, automatically may be used for Site operation, optimization, analytics, content promotion and enhancement of user experience. In accordance with applicable local law, we may use your information to contact you - to provide notices related to your activities, or offer you promotions and general updates, but we will not let any other person, including sellers and buyers, contact you, other than through your user profile on the Site.</p>

					<p>Your personal information may be stored in systems based around the world, and may be processed by third party service providers acting on our behalf. These providers may be based in countries that do not provide an equivalent level of protection for privacy as that enjoyed in the country in which you live. In that case, we will provide for adequate safeguards to protect your personal information</p>

					<p>You can exercise your rights over your personal information, by opening a <a href="./help.html"> Customer Relations ticket</a>. If you do not have an active Fiverr account, please contact us at privacy@Akazi.com. More details about the rights applicable to you are in the long version of the Policy.</p>

					<p>The above are just the highlights. We encourage you to read more about the information we collect, how we use it, understand the meaning of cookie (no, you can’t eat it) and more in the long version of our Policy below.</p>

							<h2><center>THE LONGER VERSION</center></h2>
					</div>

					<p>Akazi respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information of its users - job seekers, employers, collaborators and other visitors browsing the Site (“Users”) as well as affiliates, influencers and other collaborators interacting with Fiverr. We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the information we collect when you visit and/or use the Site. This Policy explains our privacy practices for the Site and services provided by Akazi as well as privacy practices that apply to affiliates, influencers and other collaborators who are individuals. By accessing and/or using the Site and its related sites, applications, services, goods and/or registering for a Akazi account and/or using it as a collaborator to share comments on a specific project and/or registering to our affiliate or influencer or similar program, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy, including to our collection, use, disclosure, processing and retention of your personal information. You can also learn how to limit sharing of information in this Policy.</p>

					<div class="post-quote">
							<h3><center>Information We Collect</center></h3>
					</div>

					<p>When you register to the Site, or use it as collaborator, and/or complete forms, and/or register to our affiliate or influencer or similar program, we ask you to provide certain personal information, including a valid email address, facebook or google account log in details and username. We may ask you to provide or otherwise collect additional information that you provide us, such as, your profile details, physical address, telephone number or other contact details, financial information (such as payment method and credit card number), details about other social networks linked accounts, details about your listed gigs, purchases, education, profession and expertise, and additional authentication information (such as your government issued ID, passport, or driving license, as permitted by applicable laws and as detailed in our Help Center at “Verifying Your Identity”). We also collect information about your communications with Akazi as well as communication with other users of Akazi.</p>

					<p>In addition, we collect information while you access, browse, view or otherwise use the Site. In other words, when you access the Site we are aware of your usage of the Site, and gather, collect and record the information relating to such usage, including geo-location information, IP address, device and connection information, browser information and web-log information, and all communications recorded by Users through the Site. We use that information to enhance user experience, personalize your browsing experience as well as monitor the Site for preventing fraud and inappropriate content or behaviour. We also collect supplemental information obtained from third parties such as demographic and navigation data, if applicable.</p>

					<p>Additionally, in order to improve your online experience at Fiverr, we have implemented impression reporting. While you view our ads, we gather user Global Unique Identifier, HTTP request data like, user agent, IP, host, url, country/continent from which request made, browser info, device/operating system/operating system version.</p>

					<p>Once you register, your username and additional information regarding your activity is made public and is visible to all Users of the Site. This information includes photos you upload, your published portfolio, Gig information, ratings, and additional information you may choose to add to your profile.</p>

					<div class="post-quote">
							<h3><center>How do we collect Information?</center></h3>
					</div>

					<p>You directly provide us with most of the information we collect. You do this by filling out the registration details on the Site, linking to your Fiverr account accounts of other social networks (please also see the External Links section below), completing application forms, skill tests and customer surveys (if any) as well as by posting and sharing additional information voluntarily. This can include information about sellers and their Gigs, User's location, education and profession, sharing of portfolio, ratings and feedbacks by buyers and anything you choose to add to your user profile.</p>

					<p>We also collect technical information indirectly and automatically through our systems. This information includes logging your Internet Protocol (IP) address, software configuration, operating system and use of cookies (cookies are small files sent from us to your computer and sometimes back). Cookies ultimately help us improve your navigation and ease of use of our Site. You can find further information about Cookies in this Policy below, under "Cookies".</p>

					<p>If you link, connect, or login to your Akazi Account with a third-party service (e.g. Google, Facebook, LinkedIn), we receive certain information, such as your registration and profile information from that service. This information varies and is controlled by that service or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service.</p>

					<p>We also receive certain information about you, if you are invited to Akazi by another user (for example, as part of our collaboration tools and referral program), in such case we will receive limited information, such as your email address or other contact information, and we will use it for the same purpose it was provided and in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

					<div class="post-quote">
							<h3><center>Do Not Track</center></h3>
					</div>

					<p>Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. We do not honor browser requests not to be tracked online (known as “Do Not Track”), but our cookie policy below describes how you can opt out of receiving cookies.</p>

					<div class="post-quote">
							<h3><center>How do we use the Information collected?</center></h3>
					</div>

					<p>Where relevant under applicable laws, all processing of your personal information will be justified by a "condition" for processing. In the majority of cases, processing will be justified on the basis that:</p>

                   <ul>
	                    <li><p>You have provided your consent for us to use your personal information for a specific purpose;</p></li>
	                    <li><p>Our use of your personal information is necessary to perform a contract or take steps to enter into a contract with you (e.g. to provide you with services which you have purchased);</p></li>
	                    <li><p>The processing is necessary to comply with a relevant legal obligation or regulatory obligation that we have (e.g. fraud prevention); or</p></li>
	                    <li><p>The processing is necessary to support our legitimate interests as a business (e.g. to improve our services to you), subject to your interests and fundamental rights and provided it is conducted at all times in a way that is proportionate.</p></li>
                  </ul>

                  	<p>We will use your personal information for the following purposes:</p>

                  	<ul>
	                    <li><p>to provide you with quality service and security, to operate the Site and to perform our obligations to you. For example, we use the information collected from you to verify your identity. We also use this information to establish and set up your account, verify or re-issue a password, log your activity, enable your communications with other members, provide customer support and contact you from time to time. The information helps us develop and improve our services to you and customize and personalize your experience (including by making gig suggestions, ranking search results, etc.)</p></li>
	                    <li><p>to ensure marketplace integrity, prevent fraud and maintain a safe and secure marketplace. For example, we use your information to track and prevent fraudulent activities and other inappropriate activities and, monitor content integrity, conduct security investigations and risk assessments, verify or authenticate information provided by you, enforce our Terms of Service and comply with applicable laws. We conduct certain behavioural analytics to achieve the above objectives and in limited cases, if we detect activity that we think poses a risk to the Akazi marketplace, other users, our community, or third parties, automated processes may restrict or limit your ability to use Akazi. If you would like to challenge any such decision, please contact us at privacy@Akazi.com.</p></li>
	                    <li><p>to contact you, as requested by you or otherwise approved by you.</p></li>
	                    <li><p>to promote and advertise the Akazi Site and marketplace. For example, we use the information collected from you for the purpose of sending direct marketing messages (as detailed below), to show you information that may be of interest to you, to organize and facilitate referral programs, contests or other promotional activities or events.</p></li>
	                    <li><p>to maintain appropriate business records, to comply with lawful requests by public authorities and to comply with applicable laws and regulations or as otherwise required by law.</p></li>
                  </ul>

                     <p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those set out in this Policy.</p>

                     <p>Direct marketing:</p>

                     <ul>
	                    <li><p>We use your personal information to send you direct marketing communications about our products, services or promotions from Ikikara that may be of interest to you or our related services. This may be via email, post, SMS, telephone or targeted online advertisements.</p></li>
	                    <li><p>In most cases our processing of your personal information for marketing purposes is based on our legitimate interest, although some cases (such as where required by law) will be based on your consent. You have a right to prevent direct marketing of any form at any time - this can be exercised by following the opt-out link attached to each communication or by sending an email to info@ikikara.com.</p></li>
	                    <li><p>We take steps to limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level, and to send you communications which we believe may be of interest or relevance to you, based on the information we have about you.</p></li>
                  </ul>

                    <div class="post-quote">
							<h3><center>How long do we keep your information?</center></h3>
					</div>

					<p>We apply a general rule of keeping personal information only for as long as is required to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected. However, in some circumstances we may retain your personal information for longer periods of time. We may retain your information for the following purposes:</p>

					<p>as long as it is necessary and relevant for our operations, e.g. so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenge; and</p>

					<p>in relation to personal information from closed accounts to comply with applicable laws, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our Site terms and take other actions as permitted by law.</p>

							<h3><center>Sharing Personal Information with Third Parties</center></h3>
					</div>

					<p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.</p>

If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us, you can opt-out through the link attached to each communication or by sending an email to optout@Akazi.com</p>

					<p>We share your information with service providers that provide us with services for the purpose of operating the Site, opening and operating your account as well as providing ancillary services (example - payment vendors, CRM systems, forum hosting, community management services, IT SaaS services, mailing systems or technical consultants). Our contracts with these service providers do not permit use of your information for their own (marketing) purposes. Consistent with applicable legal requirements, we take commercially reasonable steps to require third parties to adequately safeguard your personal information and only process it in accordance with our instructions;</p>

					<p>We will share your information to law enforcement agencies, public authorities or other parties in order to respond to a subpoena or court order, judicial process or to regulatory authorities, if we believe we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes; when we believe it necessary or appropriate to disclose personal information to law enforcement authorities, such as to investigate actual or suspected fraud or violations of law, breaches of security, or breaches of this Policy; to respond to claims against us; and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Akazi, our customers, or the public;</p>

					<p>We share your information with payment processors, fraud detection agencies and similar third parties for the purpose of securing the site and protecting it against fraud, unauthorized transactions (such as money laundering), claims or other liabilities;</p>

					<p>We share your information to help facilitate interactions between Users.</p>

					<p>Your personal information will also be disclosed if we go through a business transition such as a merger, sale, transfer of all or a portion of Akazi's assets, acquisition, bankruptcy or similar event. In the event that we sell any business or assets, we will disclose your data to the prospective buyer. If we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, information held by us about our users will be one of the transferred assets.</p>

					<p>Please note, your profile information and additional information regarding your activity is made public and is visible to all Users of the Site.

					</div>

					<p>Please note that the Site contains links to third party sites and if you link to a third party site from the Site, any data you provide to that site and any use of that data by the third party are not under the control of Akazi and are not subject to this Policy. You should consult the privacy policies of each site you visit. This Policy applies solely to personal information collected by our Site. If you upload content, including your personal information, to a social network and then tag the Site, your submission will be subject to that social network's terms of use and privacy policy, even where you post on an official Akazi page on the social network. We do not have control over these terms of use and privacy policies and have not reviewed their adequacy. You should therefore review these before submitting any personal information</p>

					<div class="post-quote">
							<h3><center>Security</center></h3>
					</div>

					<p>We take great care in maintaining the security of the Site and your information and in preventing unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration, destruction or damage to it through industry standard technologies and internal procedures. In addition, we contractually ensure that any third party processing your personal information equally provide for confidentiality and integrity of your data in a secure way. However, the transmission of data via the internet is not completely secure, and although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Site; any transmission is at your own risk.
